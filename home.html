    This exploration is about expanding on what I learned about WebAssembly from
    the previous exploration.

    In the last exploration I focused on simply understanding
    WebAssembly and how to create apps using it, so for this one I decided to
    encorporate what we have done in class recently by using AJAX and History.js
    to load the individual WebAssembly apps when selected by the user.
